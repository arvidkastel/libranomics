## Preface

Some years ago my friend sent me a text, asking if I had heard of the COST-tax. I had not, but reading the short version deeply resonated with me. The acronym COST is for Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax, and is proposed in the book *Radical Markets (2015)* by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. Reading about the book and watching a few YouTube videos of Weyl, sparked my interest for a market oriented political left and what properties such a hybrid might have. The intellectual journey that I embarked, took me to some really interesting places and has since profoundly shaped my thinking about economy and democracy, but also on personal and professional matters. This book is the travel notes from this journey, taken in a wish of getting fellow travelers.

The main focus of the first part is establishing an analytical framework in which we look at the world through the lens of value and power. They are developed and understood as potentially quantitative concepts. As we shall see, this framework is applicable too many spheres of human activity, and gives some explicit criteria for when ways of cooperation will be good and when they will be bad. Quite a few examples from politics, economy and the personal sphere will be discussed.

The second part is aiming to be more constructive and will give some proposals that at least in theory, gives rise to a special notion of an optimal society. The name for this optimal system is **libranomics** alluding to *economics* and *libra* (greek for scale). When economics stands for the study of house-holding with limited resources, libranomics acknowledges the fact that modern societies are governed by abundance and economies of scale. As we shall see the governing principle for this system is balance rather than house-holding. A scale can have increasing weights on booth sides, whereas money is constructed as a zero sum activity.

The book indeed makes some really ambitious claims, and an optimal society is very much such a claim. I have of course no realistic expectation that the outlines drawn in this book will solve all the worlds problems. I am aware of quite a few problems one might face implementing these ideas, and these problems are probably just skimming the surface. But I do think that once in a while you have to be bold and think long beyond practical limitations.

And with that my friends, I welcome you aboard.

## Part one - value and power

**Axiology** (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) [ἀξία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ἀξία), *axia*: "value, worth"; and [-λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-λογία), *[-logia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-logia)*: "study of") is the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) study of [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)). It includes questions about the nature and classification of values and about what kinds of things have value.

### A pair of very fancy glasses

Let's start general. Very general. Let's start with human interaction. From the borrowing of a tool over the neighbors fence, to the international trade of copper, or the voting and passing of law in a parliament, everything is human interaction. It is an incredibly complex system that exhibits what seems to be chaotic and irrational behavior, mixed with for example the very predictable steady flow of oil shipping across the oceans. To understand all of this is of course beyond ambitious and well beyond the scope of this text. Rather, we will analyze a certain aspect — the dynamics of value — of human interaction to hopefully gain some insights. I will try to sketch out in what circumstances we can assume the market to do a good job, and the limits of democracy in a time of social divison. But I will also argue that some key psychological concepts such as purpose and culture can be understood in terms of value. 

In order not to get too general well put on a pair of glasses that limits our vision to seeing how this interaction affect us in one single dimension. The dimension of value. The intricacies of social psychology and sociology are left out, and we'll focus only on how these dynamics affects our preferences. This discussion will thus have a birds eye view on our behaviour, and aims to see if we can understand some things by just looking at the value of interaction. The question is not so much how as how much. 

The key motivation is naïve: to make things better. Our first quest is to find out what we could possibly mean by better.

We'll come back to what a possible definition of this dimension can be, but for the time being, it will suffice to start with the notion that humans prefer the positive over the negative. If we have a choice we will prefer the positive. What we prefer is what is the positive.

We interact in many ways and different rules and conventions apply in different situations. In the economy we interact with money, bargaining and contracts. In the democratic context we have majority elections and set up common rules - laws - that we uphold with a monopoly of violence. Among friends and family, we interact with affection, reputation, loyalty and long term relationships. These modes of interaction have different qualities and solved different problems. The economy deals with interaction with strangers that you might not meet again, and is in this way the opposite of th e Democracy let us cooperate on certain issues.

These spheres of society have very different sets of rules, but as we shall see there is a lot of commonality to be discovered if we use or newly found glasses. 

#### Personal value

John Von Neumann (1903-1957) has been called the last polyhistor and made contributions to an astonishingly large number of fields, ranging from an array of mathematical subjects to computer science and economics. Together with the german-american economist Oskar Morgenstern, he also founded the field of game theory. In short, game theory gives a stripped down version of certain dilemmas, and has since been used for analyzing state conflict, markets and — of course — games. One key point in their *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* (1953), is unsurprisingly called the von Neumann - Morgenstern utility theorem which states that under certain conditions one can understand human behavior as acting to maximize a certain function that is called utility. The theorem says nothing about how this function looks or what behavior or consequences the agent takes into account — just that it can be modelled as if the agent has a concept of utility. 

*triangle inequality*

A very important distinction from a hedonistic value is that it isn't property of the individual. It is only a property of the behavior of the individual. The behavior can be altruistic or egoistic, maximizing for the long run or just for the short future. In this way this definition of personal value is a very practical one. It doesn't assume any large ethical framework or view of the human nature. As opposed to a hedonistic version of value, neither does it assume some hard to measure internal state of the human interior. It is just about observable behavior, and this definition of personal value will do just fine for us for the rest of this text. This is a sort of preferentialist view of value; value is what we prefer, what we prefer is value.

One can contrast this to other theories of value, but the problem is that most theories of value are more specialized and concerns ethics, aesthetics or economy. 

###### Are humans really rational?

No. Of course not! 

Or wait... eh, what lies in the concept of rationality? Doesn't it line up quite well with the notion of doing things that maximizes something similar to utility? If we constrain the notion of rationality to do things that maximizes self interest over time, then we are definitely not rational. But we are rational in the sense that we act as if there is a utility function that we try to maximize. It might change over time, it might not care equally about our future selves, but as a predictor of behavior it works. 

The question comes back to the classic high school philosophic question if it is possible to be unselfish. If you do something unselfish wouldn't you do that for yourself, thereby nullifying the assumption of unselfishness? When turning the concept of utility upside down, starting with behavior, we can see that utility as a concept is a necessity that comes out of mathematical conclusions. So for this discussion we can think of it as behavior driving utility  and not the other way around.

Personal value though, is just half the story of value. Almost always when we talk about behavior we are really talking about behavior in conjunction with interaction with other people. 

#### Value Communication Regimes

To further our discussion of value, we need a new concept that describes how people interact to exchange value. We will call it a value communication regime or VCR for short. Example of VCRs could be a democratic institution, the stock market or even the teenage family dynamics. Any situation when people are making compromises will do. A VCR will in a quantitative way formalize the ways in which the comprising individuals can exchange interests and values. The goal is to understand which VCR are good and bad, why they are good or bad and what we can do to improve them. Maybe, just maybe, it is possible to create an optimal VCR (spoiler alert: it is possible). 

In the same way we could analyze the acts of an individual as if it was trying to maximize some utility function, we can analyze a collective as if it had a utility function. The crux of the matter is that each individual also has a utility function that is maximized by that individual. This sets quite strict limits on how VCR:s works. 

The principle of power



. So possibly we could look at the economy and see that individuals maximizes their utility in that VCR. 

Let's try this in a mathematical form. This will get a bit technical so skip it if you'd like. 

Let $X$ be a state in a state space $(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$  over the variables $x_i$. The $x_i$:s could be whatever that describes the world. $x_{543}$ might be the amount of flour in my pantry, $x_{4258}$ might be the height of some specific building. They are just variables whose value affects people in some way. 

$U_i(X)$ Is the **bounded utility** of individual $i$  in the state X. This value will have a dependency on the actions of all other individuals.

$\overline{U}_i(X)$ Is the **free utility** of individual $i$  in the state X. This

$S()





#### Interpersonal value = Personal values + Value communication regime

If we accept this preferentialist view of value, by default it is only applicable to individuals, since only individuals make choices and have preferences. But by accepting an economic system of some sort, we can address the incommensurability of the individual values. If there is a way for people to communicate their needs and possibilities in a somewhat rational way, we can start to compare utilities. 

If person A says: *I'm ready to give up X kilos of Y to get Z*, 

and person B says: *ok*! 

we have established a proportion between kilos of Y per Z that is in some way preference compatible. In an economic system where many individuals are acting, all these transactions make it possible to establish a value for goods where the utilities are comparable. In our society the interpersonal value of goods on the market is just its price. 

Another Value Interaction System is our democracy where we negotiate value with voting. In this setting the interaction is not about exchanging money and goods, but negotiating to formulate laws and budgets. Our democracy is in this way also a Value Interaction System, but without an explicit price. Because of the nature of our democratic institutions the concept of price isn't applicable. But our political victories and defeats still has relative proportions, is subject to preference and thus a utility function for individuals could be established.

A third system that is less formal, is that of honour, reputation and trust. This mechanism is mostly used when people know each other and regulates how we exchange utility in close relations.

So by using different systems for interacting with value, we get different interpersonal value. A question that arises if it is possible to design a system that maximizes interpersonal value. Can we create a mechanisms that combines the insights from democracies, markets and relationships to get something that at least in theory is better than the systems we use today.

They get an interpersonal value in a system of interaction. As we shall see there are many types of these value-interaction systems that establishes different values.

#### Power

Power. Take a sip of the word. Pictures of autocratic emperors and patriarchs of bygone eras comes to mind. Sometimes they were wise, sometimes mad. Always men. Always building on hierarchy of some sort. But what is at the core of the concept of power? We also talk about power when discussing power balance in the labour market or with rich people dominating the poor. With those examples, power has more to do with a balance rather than absolute hierarchy. The definition of power we will discuss here takes hold of this balance issue and is, rather unsurprisingly, based on value:

**The power of an agent over someone is the proportion in which the agents utility changes when the other persons utility is changes as an effect of the actions of the agent** 

So basically someone is powerful when it is cheap for them to affect someone else. But the concept is constrained to the value dimension: to do things that are indifferent to the other person is not to exert power. 

For the mathematically inclined we can think of it as a quotient. $P$ is power and $U$ is utility. 
$$
P_{agent}=-\frac{\Delta U_{agent}}{\Delta U_{others}}
$$
The $-$ sign is there to signal that 

It is not hard to come up with situations of power imbalance but let's look at a few of them:

1. A rich person has in general more power than a poor. Money is of course not everything, and the rich person could be constrained by norms or a will to help the poor, but as a general rule, money is power.
2. A person that votes for a ban on gay marriage has power over gays that want to marry. The voting person is affected in a much lower degree than those affected by the law.
3. A person that drives a gasoline thirsty SUV has in that situation power over basically everyone since we are all affected by climate change. Without a mechanism to balance our power, the driver in that situation has power greater than one over all of us.
4. A house developer that builds a house that is generally considered ugly in a central area exerts power over the citizens of the town. He or she has the right to do so because it's their property, but nonetheless it is an example of power imbalance since the other citizens are affected without being able to affect. 

##### Power balance and the social optimum

With this definition of power — it can be thought of as the ability too affect without being affected in the same amount — we can ask ourselves an important question: What can be said about the utility if we know the power of the individuals in a situation? 

Let's assume that Alice is rich and Bob is poor. Furthermore Alice isn't the altruistic type so she only cares for herself. Since Alice has more power, then by definition she will not take Bobs utility in account as much as her own when making her choices (if she would do that it would contradict our behavioral definition of utility). Bob doesn't have any option to push back without  The result is that she is optimizing for something else than the social optimum. Rather, she is optimizing for her own utility. This leads to a situation where she is well off but Bob is not as well off as he could have been. Even though he might prefer interacting with Alice than not, the social optimum is not reached.

In contrast consider the situation where they have the same power. Every bad thing that Alice does to Bob can be compensated by Bob since he has the same power. Every good thing Alice does Bob can do back to her. What goes around comes around! In economic lingo the externalities of Alices actions has been internalized.

In the scenario where the individuals involved have the same power the individual optimum is the same as the social optimum. There is no longer a divide between what the individuals want and what could be called the collective will. This insight makes it reasonable to formulate a principe. It is applicable only in isolated situations but as we will see later it can be generalized to make statements about systems that evolve over time.

**The principle of power balance:** *In an isolated situation, the social optimum is reached when all individuals have the same power*



##### Power balance on the labour market

Let's go for a concrete example to get a firmer grip on this principle. The labour market. We'll look at three possible regimes for how to negotiate salaries.

###### 1. Individual bargaining 

In this setup every worker negotiates his or her salary directly with the employer. The worker has an alternative cost $\Delta U_w$ at an other company, and the employer has an alternative cost $\Delta U_e$  for an other candidate. Remember that we need a VCR to be able to compare these two amounts. If $\Delta U_{tot} = \Delta U_w + \Delta U_e > 0$ we can expect the deal to go through. If $\Delta U_w = \Delta U_e$  the parts have equal power. Equal power will lead to the social optimum for the current value communication regime. But if we are negotiating in an unequal regime such as the economy, we won't reach utilitarian optimum. Since 

But what salary is the outcome of the negotiation? The employer can pay anything between $0$ and $\Delta U_{tot}$ and both parties will be satisfied. If their reservation prices has been met the contract should be signed, but at what price? 

Interestingly enough there is no clear theoretic argument how to go about in these situations. It comes down to the parts guessing about the other parts secret reservation price, and hopes that they won't guess too high or too low. When we are looking at the labour market we can presume that the employer has more bargaining experience and information, the "slack" of the transaction mostly will go to the employer. This further takes us further away from utilitarian optimum. 



##### Executive power and bureaucracy

One aspect of power that our definition doesn't quite cover is the ability to make things happen as a extension of the agents will. Executive power is power regardless of value for the agent. As such, it is not valuable as a predictor of behavior. An operator of a big water dam might have a lot of executive power but not a lot of value based power. If he or she were to press the red button and release the havoc wreaking water masses, imprisonment and career collapse would be imminent. The feedback loop seems strong enough for all dam operators to abstain from red button tactics. 

A prime minister has a lot of both power and executive power. By design we would like the executive power to be as strong as necessary but the power as weak as possible. Low power means an uncorrupted politician, that if misbehaving, gets negative feedback and doesn't become reelected. 

A terrorist creates his own power by not regarding consequences of his actions to his own health and wellbeing. The possibility to access blueprints of bombs on the internet has given every one of us a lot of executive power. This executive power is converted to value based power by a process of indoctrination, which results that the ordinary feedback mechanisms to reduce power doesn't work for terrorists.

Executive power is thus a risk. Most of us bit our nails a bit more than usual during Donald Trumps presidency, due to his enormous executive power and his lack of restraint. This combination gave him a lot of value based power. By not complying by standard rules and norms and by having lots of cash to fall back on, Trump — like the terrorist — converted his executive power into value based power. 

An optimal bureaucrat has executive power, but in his or her profession, no value based power. Ideally the personal value should not be affected by the outcome of the professional choices and assessments he or she does. The input to the utility function of the bureaucrat should in principle only consist of the case at hand and not the utility outcome for the affected individuals.

##### Exponential executive power

A characteristic of humanities worst catastrophes are that they are an effect of systems for increasing executive power of certain individuals. Often these systems are exponential in nature. By creating hierarchies of bureaucrats, executive power can multiply in each step, creating a power machine that has very bad feedback mechanisms. If any layer of this organization had limited value based power, i.e., that negative value flowed upwards in the system many horrendous events could have been avoided. 

In one way this reasoning validates the neoliberal idea that a strong state is dangerous. Most often they don't mention the fact that this type of hierarchies is also typical of large corporations, but the point indeed holds to some degree. Exponential executive power makes quick decisions possible, but requires extraordinarily strong feedback mechanisms that couples executive power to value based power.

If this exponential executive power is as dangerous as we have reason to believe, 

##### Alternative cost and power on the market



##### Subsidiarity

When discussing distributed power, a concept that might come to mind is that of subsidiarity, the thought that every decision should be taken at the lowest possible political level. It is often connected to federalism and the European union in particular. In essence subsidiarity is just the principle of power balance applied to geography. It's just a reformulation of the principle that in order to have influence you should also accept to be influenced. If a person in Sweden votes for a specific political party that wants to direct funding to 

To further understand subsidiarity 

Note that we are using the previously discussed behavioral value definition, which means that someone that weigh the other persons utility as high as their own does not have any power over them. A parent is much stronger and capable than its child. If a sociopath or affected by substances the parent could do lots of stuff that could be catastrophic to the child, but a normal loving parent does not have power. You could call the other ability strength.

### The ethics of power balance

I find trolley problems quite boring. They are often used to convince the reader that some abstract version of utilitarianism have absurd consequences, and in that they often succeed. However, the utilitarianist can always point to some version of utilitarianism that wouldn't lead to these absurdities and so the contrived example can be dismissed. Case closed. Let's move on.

I'm not uninterested in utilitarianism though. The simpleness and logical cohesion makes it almost impossible for my mathematical sense to look past it.   There also seem to be a certain natural beauty to it that has the same kind of appeal as an elegant physical theory such as quantum mechanics or special relativity. With just a few simple assumptions one can grasp a lot of otherwise intangible aspects of the world. That's nice, albeit maybe a bit weak as a criterion of truth.

I do however think that most political takes on utilitarianism are misguided. I also think that the most interesting part of it is left out when philosophers discuss ethics. An **individualistic** take on utilitarianism lends itself to trolley problems and comparisons with other ethical frameworks, and this is most often how the theory are framed by philosophers. While admittedly interesting it has limited practical impact since it often is too abstract. In the center of the individualistic utilitarism stands the acting individual that can be wise, grim, irrational or altruistic. The ethical theory tells the individual what is the right thing to do, or at least give some tools to figure it out. But it seldom gives any practical advice on how to make individuals act more ethically.

The **collective** take, on the other hand, is most often more empirical leaning. There might be a study that claims that, on average social media makes people less happy. Therefore we should ban social media, since that will increase the greater good. An other study claims that terminal cancer patients suffer and that it would be wise to let them decide if their life should be ended. But how should we measure the impact of a social media ban on people that aren't depressed? Or those concerned over the possible slippery slope of a loosened legislation of life and death? How should these arguments be weighed against each other? And doesn't this one size fits all version of happiness have some creepy authoritarian vibe to it? There is a non-liberal paternalistic touch of the top down version of utilitarianism that to me seem counter productive. 

Neoclassical economists often lead arguments that the market is utilitarian, thereby solving the paternalistic problem of political utilitarianism. We can delegate the decisions to agents in microinteractions; the cooperative part of the state just isn't necessary. If the economy is uninterrupted by the state leads to the best possible outcome, we don't need democracy at all. But it is, to me at least, blatantly obvious that there exists distributions of resources in the world that are better than the one we currently have. It might not be easy to get there with reasonable measures, but to just argue that everything would be fine if the welfare states just vanished seems, well, a bit delusional.

The hedonist brings a solution to the table: the spreadsheet. Let's just run the numbers. But where does the numbers come from? In theory there might be a possibility of connecting with the happiness-center of the brain, but ultimately we will more often reveal the state of our brain with our behavior. 

 The classic liberal version of how a society should be ordered is based on some fundamental rights that are protected by the state

##### Microutilitarianism

A more practical version of this utilitarianism might be one that operates on a middle ground between the individualistic and the collective. The middle ground would be at the interaction level, studying under what circumstances the utility can be maximized when a few people interact. In analogy with the dichotomy of micro- and macroeconomics it could be called **microutilitarianism**. A mix of the philosophic or ethical view on one hand and the political on the other. 

Just as we reveal some of our preferences by acting on a market,

to accept the preferential view of utility and let our behavior be the base for the spreadsheet. Preferences aren't however revealed in a

## Social processes

Let's first get the concepts straight. A social process is something we do that affects our utility. So basically anything. Can something as general be useful? Well, the strength of the idea lies in when we look at the aggregate utility of the process and how that varies when the process scales. Some really interesting corollaries falls out of this definition.

We can distinguish some fundamental types of social processes categories by how they scale. Note that these properties may not apply to all sizes of the process. They can be increasing returns for small amounts of participants, but gradually morph into to a decreasing returns process.

1. **Decreasing returns** This is the dynamic of competition. When resources are limited or when manufacturing capabilities are hard to scale up. The agents participating gets on average less and less when more people join. Typical of this type of process is hostility towards newcomers, since it is reasonable to believe the new person will make life harder for the ones already participating.
2. **Constant returns** When something is easy to start but hard to scale it is generally a constant returns process. Traditionally this is the model of the basic exchange economy. I get a cow fur, you get one bag of flour. Whomever can raise a cow or has a field of wheat can participate in the exchange. If you would like to raise 10 cows you will need ten times the silage, which will render you 10 times the cost. An other important example of a constant returns process is that of status. We'll come back to that.
3. **Increasing returns** The cornerstone of the modern economy is increasing returns. Close to everything you see around you (unless you're... camping?) is the result of increasing returns. The production of information and knowledge is 

##### Integration and segregation

There is a saying that no two liberal democracies has ever fought a war. It probably isn't completely true with reasonable definitions of war and democracy, but the stats are indeed leaning towards the conclusion that democratic states with open economies has a peacekeeping effect. If we look at modern economies as dominated by increasing returns processes we can see why. The economies of scale makes trading more favorable, and induces a cost of conflict that at its best prevents war.

#### Solidarity and time

So far we have concentrated on how value applies as a predictor for behavior as a weighting of interests. But we don't live in one moment in time, but rather during a (hopefully) long time. My self interest is thus not an easy concept, as my preference in one moment might differ from that in another moment. What moment should we choose? 

The simplest possibility is to change our model and to think of a person as lots of persons in different times with slightly different preferences. We can understand each

### The USP for the market is flawed

Paul Krugman (1953-), nobel* laureate and prolific writer on the left flank of the economics field. Probably he doesn't need more introduction than that. His main contribution to academia and the insights has been awarded for are in the area of international trade. More specifically he has studied how economies of scale and competition interact. The conclusion is that international trade makes economies of scale less prone of monopoly. 

Why, at all, is this an issue? Shouldn't competition solve market inefficiencies and states of monopoly? Well, the situation isn't that simple. Lets go through the three types of returns of scale.

**Diminishing returns** The scenario when more people makes the average situation worse for the people involved. A typical example is a factory floor that at a certain point gets crowded and the efficiency of the production gets smaller.

**Constant returns** The scenario when more people makes the average situation about the same. 

**Increasing reurn** The scenario when more people makes the average situation about the same

### The psychology of libranomics

Remember the last time you went to the mall? Chances are relatively good that you were approached by one or more salespersons trying to hook you up on their latest offer. It is also quite probable that competitors approach you with similar offers. We have come too think that this is a sign of health of the market and with the ruling system this is indeed the case. But at least to me there is a nagging feeling that it is a bit weird that competition and not cooperation is the best way of interaction between organisations. Isn't it something deeply ineffective with this system?

The answer is yes, but also no. As we have seen in previous chapters competition is more effective than monopoly and often more effective than a bureaucrat run organization. But we have also learned how a more cooperative economy can be even better than all these. I will argue that it also might transform how we think about ourselves and or peers in the society.
